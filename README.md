# Writing a simple pipeline
I am trying to learn Python on my free time, and to do it I decided to 
create some simple tools that should help me speed up my workflow and
scene creation inside Houdini, and hopefully with time I will be able to
integrate more softwares withing it like Nuke and Maya.

The scripts might not be elegant and this is because I am fairly new to the 
language, but with time they will get better.
